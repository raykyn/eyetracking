How does the 60Hz-Dataset compare to the 2000Hz Dataset?

Dispersion-based Algorithm:
Finding the correct thresholds (especially because you need to find 2) is much harder
when using the high-frequency dataset compared to the low frequency dataset.
Our runs on the high-frequency dataset either ended in the fixations following exactly
the data points or in blobbing together to a single or a few huge fixation points.

Velocity-based Algorithm:
How the data points are labelled is highly dependent on the velocity threshold
chosen by the researcher. In our example, a threshold of 1 (px/ms) does okay to
differentiate between saccades and fixations on the 60Hz dataset, but is far
too low for the 2000Hz dataset and results in labelling too many datapoints as fixations.
